A description of what the code does (what does your application do?) -->

Also, it's always nice to make the README nice and good looking, emojis and images are always a nice touch to add grin

Our Team:
Maha Foro @maha276 <br>
Sabeel Halabi @sabeel29 <br>
Sara Abu Zalaf @sara3112

We created a web page to advertize our team of developers, so that clients can get to know us and hopefully hire us.

We used HTML and CSS to make a potfolio page for our team.

We learned how to work together as a team.
We learned new HTML and CSS techniques for example: how to use @media query, how to build a form, and adding a navigation link.


One of the challenges we encountered is, making the form work properly, first we couldn't receive emails from users.
Another one was picking a background image that the whole teams approves.

We would make our web content more accessible to people with disabilities by adding an audio reader for example.
